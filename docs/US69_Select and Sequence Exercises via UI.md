As a facilitator,
I want to build a session by selecting exercises from the LSB catalogue and sequencing them,
So that I can design my class structure directly in the app without using external files.

Acceptance Criteria:

    The app displays exercises filtered by user-selected phase (1–5 or all).

    User can select an exercise and add it to the session with one click.

    Exercises are added as tuples: (exercise code + name, music = blank by default).

    Session list supports dynamic reordering of exercises.

    Sequence numbers adjust automatically to reflect current order.
